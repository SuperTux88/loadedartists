Gregor, you’ve given us all tons of beautiful memories together these past 10 years.
Many of us have been here for a good portion of that, and many of us have only recently found you.
But I think we can all agree that you’ve made such a positive impact on us, bringing a smile to our faces,
and bringing us all together as a community. We’ve all made friends with each other, and it’s in large part
to all of your efforts and time you invest into us.

You’ve done so well, and I think that you’re going to have another ten years of fruitful comics, new ideas,
thoughtful changes, and amazing community building! {{< emote loadLove >}}

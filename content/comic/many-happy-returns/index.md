Yo, what is up my homie g peeps? Alright enough of that. When this project was announced I was torn between two comics.
Comic A was taken by Steven, so I went with B which is considered one of the most cursed panels in LoadingArtist history,
now even further immortalized. Peace out y’all, I’m getting clear eyes to try to purge this from my corneas.

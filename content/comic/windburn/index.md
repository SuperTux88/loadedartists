Congratulations on 10 years of successfully pulling out brain turds and turning (most of) them into great comics!
I'm so glad I could be a part of your community and have a hand in the comic-making process through all these years.
I know those paragraphs of suggestions I would post after the Celebration made you die a little inside each time, but
I swear it was all out of love and respect for your consistently incredible work <3

Hat Guy wakes up that morning feeling a little sick. It must’ve been that bad sushi he had last night. He gets out of bed and feels bloated. “Ugh,” he sighs, “That’s the last time I eat seafood and drink.” As he walks to the bathroom, he keeps tripping over his own feet. He rubs his legs, “How much did I drink last night? I feel so numb.” Hat Guy enters the bathroom and turns on the light. His vision is blurry, but he looks in the mirror. It might just be his eyes adjusting or the lighting, but his skin has a sort of….blue tint to it. Hat Guy shakes his head dismissively. He starts washing his face and notices what he only assumes to be stray mustache whiskers. He reaches for his razor but sees that his hand is still blue, and his…. fingers are gone? He stumbles back in shock, and when he picks himself back up again, his reflection baffles him. He now had blue skin, fins, whiskers, and an animal snout. Hat Guy looks down and now his legs have fused together into a tail. “What am I, some sorta deformed seal?!” he tries to say, but his words transform into coos and whines.

It’s almost 2:30 and Red Shirt Guy hasn’t heard from his friend yet. “Hope he doesn’t feel too hungover,” he chuckles to himself. He visits Hat Guy’s house to check-in. When no one answers the door, he walks in. “Hey!” He shouts out, “You alright dude? We were supposed to meet up fifteen minutes ago!” A crash comes from the other room. “Dude?” he slowly opens the door, “What’s going on?” On the bathroom floor, he finds a thrashing, panicked manatee.

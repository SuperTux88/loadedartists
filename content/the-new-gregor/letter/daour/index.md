PS: Here's a little 2-in-1 joke to lighten things up. What's the similarity between the Loading Artist book and the Black Widow movie? They're both long overdue, they both could have been made years ago and both were constantly delayed. Now, what's the difference between the Loading Artist book and the Black Widow movie? That the Black Widow movie is coming out in two weeks <3

PPS: he meant RESOLUTIONS . txt

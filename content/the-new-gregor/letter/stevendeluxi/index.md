Dearest Gregor,

happy birthday! Hope this year will be as amazing as the years of entertainment you've been providing to us! Not to mention the past year alone! I cannot thank you enough. Not only for the amazing comics and streams, combined with your quirky-weird (and therefore relatable to me) nature, but also the amazing community you've built up! I mean, you can see it for yourself right now! Never have I felt more welcome and among friends online than here! Stay you, stay awesome!

Much Love, StevenDeLuckyToBeHere

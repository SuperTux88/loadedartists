Hey Gregor,

‘Sup.

Also, I’m so happy to have re-joined the community back in October. The good thing is this meant I wasn’t there during the making of Many Happy Returns, or else I might have put a stop to it. You’re an inspiration, and you’re a delight to watch, and you always have such a positive energy about you.

We all really appreciate everything you do. And you should treat yourself for your birthday. It’s a special day for a, *ahem*, special artist.

Dear Gregor,

Happy birthday, man. Two years of your streams, two years that I can't imagine without Loading Artist. I met so many people that I love now thanks to you, and made so many memories, and for that I'm forever grateful. I wish you all the best. And yes, that is Copy and Paste in [my drawing](/the-new-gregor/quote/835) :)

Jay

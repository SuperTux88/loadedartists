Moin, Gregor.

Happy 32nd birthday. When I turned 32 I tried to turn around the digits on my cake to make it look like it was my 23rd instead. Didn't work, my mom saw it and changed it.

Your streams gave me many hours of joy. I always thought there couldn't be someone more awkward than me and here you are. Making people happy and laugh. Keep being yourself.

Enjoy the shirt. It's how I imagine heaven for you.

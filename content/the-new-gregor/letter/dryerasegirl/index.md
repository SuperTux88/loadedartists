Hey Gregor,

Sometimes you're the sweetest human, and sometimes you're a nasty old man, but I just can't quit you.

Okay, okay, jokes aside, thank you for sharing your time and talents with all of us. You're funny, relatably weird, and fun to spend time with via the interwebs, and I'm so glad to have found your twitch channel and amazing content. And I've made an unexpected number of friendships with people in the community that I wouldn't give up for anything.

I guess what I'm trying to say is... you're a weirdo, and we love you.

Heyo Gregor,

Since I'm not the best with compliments or sentimental words of affirmation, I figure I'll just make you feel old instead.

I recently realized that when I first started watching your streams, it was the summer before my freshman year. Now it's the summer before my freshman year... \*of college\*. Anyway, enough of existentialism. Here's to another four years, and another four, and another four, and.... well, probably at least till you're actually in your forties {{< emote loadErp >}}

Psycho Manatee

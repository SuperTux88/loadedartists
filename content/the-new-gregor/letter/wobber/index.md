merry birthday gregor!

almost a full year now of watching your streams, and it has been amazing to slowly become part of the community. so many people are just amazing and friendly all the time, and i don't think there's a single person in the community i outright dislike (which is CERTAINLY surprising, knowing myself). thank you so much for drawing sort of decent comics and very good lola bunny birthday cakes {{< emote loadLewd >}}

\- wobber!

Instead of Gregor drawing birthday cakes for us, the community got together in secret {{< emote loadLurk >}}
and drew the biggest birthday cake in LoadingArtist history! {{< emote loadWow >}}

Special thanks to Camjocotem for the idea and to Li (from [Exocomics](https://www.exocomics.com/)) for organizing
everything and combining everything into one big image! {{< emote loadLove >}}
